# Python and Jupyter for UBC Mathematics

## About

[Python](https://www.python.org) is an open source general purpose programming language and [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) is a web application for creating computational documents with Python. [Syzygy](https://ubc.syzygy.ca) is an instance of a [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub) and is managed by the [Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences](https://www.pims.math.ca). Syzygy hosts Jupyter notebooks for all UBC students, faculty and staff. Python and Jupyter are an important part of the teaching mission of the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.math.ubc.ca) at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca) and our goal is to get students and instructors up and running quickly with Python and Jupyter.
